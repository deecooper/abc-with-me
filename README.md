<h1 align="center">ABC With Me</h1>




ABC With Me is an interative alphabet game aimed at preschoolers. Most english speaking children aged 3 + have been introduced to the alphabet in some form and although they might know the alphabet song most children of that age dont know what the alphabet letters look like. 

ABC With Me shows the player a fun illustration. Once the user clicks the sound button they will hear me telling them what the picture is and which letter the illustration starts with. The user should then pick the correct letter. If the user chooses the right letter they will hear me saying well done and another illustration will appear on the screen. If the user chooses the wrong letter they will hear me saying try again and the score/ illustration will remain the same until they choose the right letter.

### Other testing

I got my son who is 3 and a half to play this game. I had to show him which button to press and go through the letters of the alphabet with him . He enjoyed the illustrations and the audio. 

ABC With Me was tested on different size screens using the website Responsinator (http://www.responsinator.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fdeecooper.github.io%2Fabc-with-me%2F)
and Dev tools on Chrome. The game is responsive on all screen sizes.

I tested the game on Google Chrome and Internet Explorer.


<h2> Design </h2>

### Colours

As this game is aimed at young children I wanted to create a fun colourful interface.

The main colours used in this game are shown below.
I choose red, blue and yellow as they are the primary colours. I also used green for the buttons and the logo text. Children are attracted to bright colours I kept this in mind whilst creating my game.

I created all of the illustrations myself using Abobe Illustrator.

I created the ABC logo in Adobe Illustrator.
